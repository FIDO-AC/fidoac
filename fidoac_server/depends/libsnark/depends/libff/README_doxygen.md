# Introduction

This is the developer documentation of Clearmatics' fork of Libff (initially developped by the SCIPR-Lab and contributors). This library should be treated as experimental code and is thus not fit for production use.

The software is an open source project and all community contributions are welcomed. The project is released under the MIT license.

See https://github.com/clearmatics/libff for further information about the project.
